# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** written in **C**. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, and it tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc game.c -o game
